<b>The Affordability Mandate and the Tipping Point: How Eight Congressional Districts Determined the 2025 Healthcare Crisis.</b>

Despite the availability of Medicaid and other publicly funded healthcare benefits, individuals experiencing homelessness in urban environments—particularly in Baltimore, Maryland—continue to face significant barriers to healthcare utilization. Existing research suggests that education levels, income disparities, and health literacy play critical roles in shaping access to and engagement with healthcare services. However, the persistence of underutilization despite formal accessibility indicates the presence of deeper structural, socioeconomic, and psychological barriers. Systemic factors such as bureaucratic complexity, distrust in medical institutions, mental health challenges, and logistical constraints (e.g., lack of transportation, unstable living conditions) further exacerbate healthcare disparities among this vulnerable population.

This study aims to investigate the interplay between educational attainment, income levels, and health awareness in influencing Medicaid and healthcare benefit utilization among homeless individuals in Baltimore. Additionally, it seeks to identify the underlying factors that contribute to persistent non-engagement with available healthcare resources. By critically analyzing these barriers, this research will provide evidence-based insights to inform policy interventions that can enhance healthcare accessibility, improve program efficacy, and ultimately bridge the gap between healthcare availability and utilization among urban homeless populations.
